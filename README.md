### 💬 About me
My NicName is fromitive.
'fromitive' is the word that combined 'from' and 'primitive'.

All issues of the idea we created did not arise when it's are created.
To solve the problem, we need to think about what the creator's primitive idea.
To find that, we start *from* the creator's *primitive* idea.

search it, ask it, analyze it and find it
